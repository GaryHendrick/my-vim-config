This is my vim configuration.  Note that the .vimrc file is included in a ~/.vimrc configuration
by adding the following to that .vimrc file

source .vim/.vimrc

This configuration is dependent upon the package:
ctags

This configuration is also dependent upon the following plugins:
csupport
python-mode
taglist

In the future you shouldn't have to go through so many edits to get this going
