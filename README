This is my vim configuration.  Note that the .vimrc file is included in a ~/.vimrc configuration
by adding the following to that .vimrc file

source ~/.vim/.vimrc

Set up Vundle through the Vundle Quick Start Guide and run :PluginInstall
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

If using this config in windows, create links and junctions to point to the appropriate configuration files
`mklink` will provide this capability on the windows command prompt.

This configuration is dependent upon the package:
ctags

This configuration is also dependent upon the following plugins:
csupport
python-mode
taglist

In the future you shouldn't have to go through so many edits to get this going
